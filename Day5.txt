-----------------------------------------
D.For Each
const data = {
  "name": "Dina",
  "age": 24,

3.Read about the difference between window, screen, and document in javascript

a.Window Object:

The Window object represents the window in the browser. The window object is automatically created from the browser.
All browsers support the Window object. Global variables are the properties of the Window objects, 
and global functions are the methods of the Window object.

Syntax:
window.alert("Hello, world!");
---------------------------------------------------------
b.Screen Object:
*The screen object represents the properties and features of the user's screen or monitor. 
It provides information about the screen's dimensions, resolution, and color depth.

*This object is useful for designing responsive web applications that adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.

Syntax:
console.log(`Screen width: ${screen.width}`);
console.log(`Screen height: ${screen.height}`);
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.Document Object:
*The document object represents the web page itself and allows you to access and manipulate its content. 
It's part of the Document Object Model (DOM), which is a hierarchical representation of the web page's structure and content.

*You can use the document object to interact with HTML elements, change their content, attributes, and styles, and respond to user interactions like clicks and keystrokes.

*The document object is essential for dynamic web page creation and manipulation.

Syntax:
const element = document.getElementById("myElement");
element.textContent = "New Content";
